# python-api-challenge
This project took on two challenges.

In WeatherPy, we look at how weather changes based on latitude, with particular focus trends closest to the equator. In this challenge, we generate more than random cities from 1,500 latitude and longitude pairs, pull their weather information from OpenWeatherMap, and analyze trends in four weather categories - temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.

In VacationPy, we are looking for ideal vacation locations based on the WeatherPy's findings. Using Google Places API, this project will identify hotels nearest cities with ideal weather conditions - namely, temperatures in the 70s, high visibility, and low wind.

In order to run the program, you will need to create a file named api_keys.py. In this file, create two variables - gkey and weather_api_key.
